# 🧠 UpDocs: AGI-based Document Feedback Assistant

Welcome to **UpDocs**, an AI-powered document assistant created by **Team Bremen** as part of the Upstage track at the AI Hackathon.

## 🚀 Overview
UpDocs helps users — especially students, researchers, and new hires — improve their documents with minimal manual effort. By uploading a draft, users receive structured, insightful feedback based on high-quality references, all powered by Upstage APIs and AGI reasoning.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
In academic labs and corporate environments, newcomers face challenges in writing structured, high-quality documents. Common struggles include:

- Finding and analyzing well-written reference documents
- Understanding structure, tone, and logical flow
- Receiving timely feedback from mentors or seniors

> 🧪 A global survey (n=24) revealed:
> - 50%+ of respondents struggle to compare and structure documents
> - 80%+ spend over 50% of their time iterating on writing tasks

---

## 💡 Our Solution
UpDocs tackles these challenges by:

1. Parsing uploaded PDFs using Upstage APIs
2. Extracting structure, content, and style info
3. Matching similar reference documents
4. Comparing tone, structure, and flow
5. Generating visual feedback and improvement suggestions
6. Supporting interactive chatbot revision (via Perplexity)

## 🎯 MVP Focus: Academic Papers
Our MVP targets **IEEE-style academic papers**, because:
- They follow strict formats
- Public datasets are accessible
- They pose high writing complexity

---

## 🛠 Architecture
**User Flow**
1. Upload paper (PDF)
2. Upstage APIs: `ocr`, `parsing`, `info extraction`
3. Match similar IEEE papers
4. Compare and annotate suggestions
5. Ask/Revise through Perplexity chatbot

## 🔥 Why It Matters
UpDocs empowers users by:
- Reducing time spent on formatting
- Improving writing quality
- Accelerating feedback cycles
