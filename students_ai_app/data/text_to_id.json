  "The explosion of image data on the Internet has the po- tential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with im- ages and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \"ImageNet\", a large- scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500- 1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the se- mantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Construct- ing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechan- ical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, im- age classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical struc- ture of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to re- searchers in the computer vision community and beyond.": 4,
  "1. Introduction": 5,
  "The digital era has brought with it an enormous explo- sion of data. The latest estimations put a number of more than 3 billion photos on Flickr, a similar number of video clips on YouTube and an even larger number for images in the Google Image Search database. More sophisticated and robust models and algorithms can be proposed by exploit- ing these images, resulting in better applications for users to index, retrieve, organize and interact with these data. But exactly how such data can be utilized and organized is a problem yet to be solved. In this paper, we introduce a new image database called \"ImageNet\", a large-scale ontology of images. We believe that a large-scale ontology of images is a critical resource for developing advanced, large-scale": 6,
  "content-based image search and image understanding algo- rithms, as well as for providing critical training and bench- marking data for such algorithms.": 7,
  "ImageNet uses the hierarchical structure of WordNet [9]. Each meaningful concept in WordNet, possibly described by multiple words or word phrases, is called a \"synonym set\" or \"synset\". There are around 80, 000 noun synsets in WordNet. In ImageNet, we aim to provide on aver- age 500-1000 images to illustrate each synset. Images of each concept are quality-controlled and human-annotated as described in Sec. 3.2. ImageNet, therefore, will offer tens of millions of cleanly sorted images. In this paper, we report the current version of ImageNet, consisting of 12 \"subtrees\": mammal, bird, fish, reptile, amphibian, vehicle, furniture, musical instrument, geological formation, tool, flower, fruit. These subtrees contain 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images. Fig. 1 shows a snapshot of two branches of the mammal and vehicle subtrees. The database is publicly available at http : / / www · image-net · org.": 8,
  "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We first show that ImageNet is a large-scale, accurate and diverse image database (Section 2). In Section 4, we present a few simple application examples by exploiting the current Ima- geNet, mostly the mammal and vehicle subtrees. Our goal is to show that ImageNet can serve as a useful resource for visual recognition applications such as object recognition, image classification and object localization. In addition, the construction of such a large-scale and high-quality database can no longer rely on traditional data collection methods. Sec. 3 describes how ImageNet is constructed by leverag- ing Amazon Mechanical Turk.": 9,
  "2. Properties of ImageNet": 10,
  "ImageNet is built upon the hierarchical structure pro- vided by WordNet. In its completion, ImageNet aims to contain in the order of 50 million cleanly labeled full reso- lution images (500-1000 per synset). At the time this paper is written, ImageNet consists of 12 subtrees. Most analysis will be based on the mammal and vehicle subtrees.": 11,

  "Hierarchy ImageNet organizes the different classes of images in a densely populated semantic hierarchy. The main asset of WordNet [9] lies in its semantic structure, i.e. its ontology of concepts. Similarly to WordNet, synsets of images in ImageNet are interlinked by several types of re- lations, the \"IS-A\" relation being the most comprehensive and useful. Although one can map any dataset with cate-": 41,

The number of images for the largest node is shown for each tree. Shared nodes between an ESP tree and an ImageNet tree are colored in red.": 43,
  "gory labels into a semantic hierarchy by using WordNet, the density of ImageNet is unmatched by others. For example, to our knowledge no existing vision dataset offers images of 147 dog categories. Fig. 3 compares the \"cat\" and \"cattle\" subtrees of ImageNet and the ESP dataset [25]. We observe that ImageNet offers much denser and larger trees.": 44,
  "1 About 20% of the synsets have very few images, because either there are very few web images available, e.g. \"vespertilian bat\", or the synset by definition is difficult to be illustrated by images, e.g. \"two-year-old horse\".": 45,
  "Accuracy We would like to offer a clean dataset at all levels of the WordNet hierarchy. Fig. 4 demonstrates the labeling precision on a total of 80 synsets randomly sam- pled at different tree depths. An average of 99.7% preci- sion is achieved on average. Achieving a high precision for all depths of the ImageNet tree is challenging because the lower in the hierarchy a synset is, the harder it is to classify, e.g. Siamese cat versus Burmese cat.": 46,

In an attempt to tackle the difficult problem of quan- tifying image diversity, we compute the average image of each synset and measure lossless JPG file size which reflects the amount of information in an image. Our idea is that a synset containing diverse images will result in a blurrier av- erage image, the extreme being a gray image, whereas a synset with little diversity will result in a more structured, sharper average image. We therefore expect to see a smaller JPG file size of the average image of a more diverse synset.

  "Small image datasets A number of well labeled small datasets (Caltech101/256 [8, 12], MSRC [22], PASCAL [7] etc.) have served as training and evaluation benchmarks for most of today's computer vision algorithms. As com- puter vision research advances, larger and more challenging": 58,

  "datasets are needed for the next generation of algorithms. The current ImageNet offers 20x the number of categories, and 100x the number of total images than these datasets.": 61,
  "TinyImage TinyImage [24] is a dataset of 80 million 32 x 32 low resolution images, collected from the Inter- net by sending all words in WordNet as queries to image search engines. Each synset in the TinyImage dataset con- tains an average of 1000 images, among which 10-25% are possibly clean images. Although the TinyImage dataset has had success with certain applications, the high level of noise and low resolution images make it less suitable for gen- eral purpose algorithm development, training, and evalua- tion. Compared to the TinyImage dataset, ImageNet con- tains high quality synsets (~ 99% precision) and full reso- lution images with an average size of around 400 x 350.": 62,
  "ESP dataset The ESP dataset is acquired through an on- line game [25]. Two players independently propose labels to one image with the goal of matching as many words as possible in a certain time limit. Millions of images are la- beled through this game, but its speeded nature also poses a major drawback. Rosch and Lloyd [20] have demonstrated that humans tend to label visual objects at an easily acces- sible semantic level termed as \"basic level\" (e.g. bird), as opposed to more specific level (\"sub-ordinate level\", e.g. sparrow), or more general level (\"super-ordinate level\", e.g. vertebrate). Labels collected from the ESP game largely concentrate at the \"basic level\" of the semantic hierarchy as illustrated by the color bars in Fig. 6. ImageNet, how- ever, demonstrates a much more balanced distribution of images across the semantic hierarchy. Another critical dif- ference between ESP and ImageNet is sense disambigua- tion. When human players input the word \"bank\", it is un- clear whether it means \"a river bank\" or a \"financial insti- tution\". At this large scale, disambiguation becomes a non- trivial task. Without it, the accuracy and usefulness of the ESP data could be affected. ImageNet, on the other hand, does not have this problem by construction. See section 3.2 for more details. Lastly, most of the ESP dataset is not pub- licly available. Only 60K images and their labels can be accessed [1].": 63,
  "LabelMe and Lotus Hill datasets LabelMe [21] and the Lotus Hill dataset [27] provide 30k and 50k labeled and seg- mented images, respectively 5 These two datasets provide complementary resources for the vision community com- pared to ImageNet. Both only have around 200 categories, but the outlines and locations of objects are provided. Im- ageNet in its current form does not provide detailed object outlines (see potential extensions in Sec. 5.1), but the num- ber of categories and the number of images per category": 64,

  "3. Constructing ImageNet": 74,
  "ImageNet is an ambitious project. Thus far, we have constructed 12 subtrees containing 3.2 million images. Our goal is to complete the construction of around 50 million images in the next two years. We describe here the method we use to construct ImageNet, shedding light on how prop- erties of Sec. 2 can be ensured in this process.": 75,
  "3.1. Collecting Candidate Images": 76,
  "The first stage of the construction of ImageNet involves collecting candidate images for each synset. The average": 77,
  "accuracy of image search results from the Internet is around 10% [24]. ImageNet aims to eventually offer 500-1000 clean images per synset. We therefore collect a large set of candidate images. After intra-synset duplicate removal, each synset has over 10K images on average.": 78,
  "We collect candidate images from the Internet by query- ing several image search engines. For each synset, the queries are the set of WordNet synonyms. Search engines typically limit the number of images retrievable (in the or- der of a few hundred to a thousand). To obtain as many im- ages as possible, we expand the query set by appending the queries with the word from parent synsets, if the same word appears in the gloss of the target synset. For example, when querying \"whippet\", according to WordNet's gloss a \"small slender dog of greyhound type developed in England\", we also use \"whippet dog\" and \"whippet greyhound\".": 79,
  "To further enlarge and diversify the candidate pool, we translate the queries into other languages [10], including Chinese, Spanish, Dutch and Italian. We obtain accurate translations by WordNets in those languages [3, 2, 4, 26].": 80,
  "3.2. Cleaning Candidate Images": 81,
  "To collect a highly accurate dataset, we rely on humans to verify each candidate image collected in the previous step for a given synset. This is achieved by using the service of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an online platform on which one can put up tasks for users to complete and to get paid. AMT has been used for labeling vision data [23]. With a global user base, AMT is particularly suitable for large scale labeling.": 82,
  "In each of our labeling tasks, we present the users with a set of candidate images and the definition of the target synset (including a link to Wikipedia). We then ask the users to verify whether each image contains objects of the synset. We encourage users to select images regardless of occlusions, number of objects and clutter in the scene to": 83,

  "ensure diversity.": 89,
  "While users are instructed to make accurate judgment, we need to set up a quality control system to ensure this accuracy. There are two issues to consider. First, human users make mistakes and not all users follow the instruc- tions. Second, users do not always agree with each other, especially for more subtle or confusing synsets, typically at the deeper levels of the tree. Fig. 7(left) shows an example of how users , judgments differ for \"Burmese cat\".": 90,
  "The solution to these issues is to have multiple users in- dependently label the same image. An image is considered positive only if it gets a convincing majority of the votes. We observe, however, that different categories require dif- ferent levels of consensus among users. For example, while five users might be necessary for obtaining a good consen- sus on \"Burmese cat\" images, a much smaller number is needed for \"cat\" images. We develop a simple algorithm to dynamically determine the number of agreements needed for different categories of images. For each synset, we first randomly sample an initial subset of images. At least 10 users are asked to vote on each of these images. We then ob- tain a confidence score table, indicating the probability of an image being a good image given the user votes (Fig. 7(right) shows examples for \"Burmese cat\" and \"cat\"). For each of remaining candidate images in this synset, we proceed with the AMT user labeling until a pre-determined confidence score threshold is reached. It is worth noting that the con- fidence table gives a natural measure of the \"semantic diffi- culty\" of the synset. For some synsets, users fail to reach a majority vote for any image, indicating that the synset can- not be easily illustrated by images 6 Fig. 4 shows that our algorithm successfully filters the candidate images, result- ing in a high percentage of clean images per synset.": 91,
  "6An alternative explanation is that we did not obtain enough suitable candidate images. Given the extensiveness of our crawling scheme, this is a rare scenario.": 92,
  "4. ImageNet Applications": 93,
  "In this section, we show three applications of ImageNet. The first set of experiments underline the advantages ofhav- ing clean, full resolution images. The second experiment exploits the tree structure of ImageNet, whereas the last ex- periment outlines a possible extension and gives more in- sights into the data.": 94,
  "4.1. Non-parametric Object Recognition": 95,
  "Given an image containing an unknown object, we would like to recognize its object class by querying similar images in ImageNet. Torralba et al. [24] has demonstrated that, given a large number of images, simple nearest neigh- bor methods can achieve reasonable performances despite a high level of noise. We show that with a clean set of full resolution images, object recognition can be more accurate, especially by exploiting more feature level information.": 96,
  "We run four different object recognition experiments. In all experiments, we test on images from the 16 common categories 7 between Caltech256 and the mammal subtree. We measure classification performance on each category in the form of an ROC curve. For each category, the negative set consists of all images from the other 15 categories. We now describe in detail our experiments and results(Fig. 8).": 97,
  "1. NN-voting + noisy ImageNet First we replicate one of the experiments described in [24], which we refer to as \"NN-voting\" hereafter. To imitate the TinyIm- age dataset (i.e. images collected from search engines without human cleaning), we use the original candi- date images for each synset (Section 3.1) and down- sample them to 32 x 32. Given a query image, we re- trieve 100 of the nearest neighbor images by SSD pixel distance from the mammal subtree. Then we perform classification by aggregating votes (number of nearest neighbors) inside the tree of the target category. 2. NN-voting + clean ImageNet Next we run the same NN-voting experiment described above on the clean ImageNet dataset. This result shows that having more accurate data improves classification performance. 3. NBNN We also implement the Naive Bayesian Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) method proposed in [5] to underline the usefulness of full resolution im- ages. NBNN employs a bag-of-features representa- tion of images. SIFT [15] descriptors are used in this experiment.

  "method which we call the \"tree-max classifier\". Imagine you have a classifier at each synset node of the tree and you want to decide whether an image contains an object of that synset or not. The idea is to not only consider the classi- fication score at a node such as \"dog\", but also of its child synsets, such as \"German shepherd\", \"English terrier\", etc. The maximum of all the classifier responses in this subtree becomes the classification score of the query image.": 113,
  "Fig. 9 illustrates the result of our experiment on the mammal subtree. Note that our algorithm is agnostic to any method used to learn image classifiers for each synset. In this case, we use an AdaBoost-based classifier proposed by [6]. For each synset, we randomly sample 90% of the im- ages to form the positive training image set, leaving the rest of the 10% as testing images. We form a common neg- ative image set by aggregating 10 images randomly sam- pled from each synset. When training an image classifier for a particular synset, we use the positive set from this synset as well as the common negative image set excluding the images drawn from this synset, and its child and parent synsets.": 114,
  "We evaluate the classification results by AUC (the area under ROC curve). Fig. 9 shows the results of AUC for synsets at different levels of the hierarchy, compared with an independent classifier that does not exploit the tree struc- ture of ImageNet. The plot indicates that images are easier to classify at the bottom of the tree (e.g. star-nosed mole, minivan, polar bear) as opposed to the top of the tree (e.g. vehicles, mammal, artifact, etc.). This is most likely due to stronger visual coherence near the leaf nodes of the tree.": 115,
  "At nearly all levels, the performance of the tree-max classifier is consistently higher than the independent clas- sifier. This result shows that a simple way of exploiting the ImageNet hierarchy can already provide substantial im- provement for the image classification task without addi- tional training or model learning.": 116,

First, for training a robust object de- tection algorithm one often needs localized objects in dif- ferent poses and under different viewpoints. Second, hav- ing localized objects in cluttered scenes enables users to use ImageNet as a benchmark dataset for object localization al- gorithms. In this section we present results of localization on 22 categories from different depths of the WordNet hier- archy.

  "We annotated 100 images in 22 different categories of the mammal and vehicle subtrees with bounding boxes around the objects of that category. Fig. 10 shows precision and recall values. Note that precision is low due to extreme variability of the objects and because of small objects which have hardly any salient regions.": 147,
  "Fig. 11 shows sampled bounding boxes on different classes. The colored region is the detected bounding box, while the original image is in light gray.": 148,
  "In order to illustrate the diversity of ImageNet inside each category, Fig. 12 shows results on running k-means clustering on the detected bounding boxes after converting them to grayscale and rescaling them to 32 x 32. All average images, including those for the entire cluster, are created with approximately 40 images. While it is hard to iden- tify the object in the average image of all bounding boxes (shown in the center) due to the diversity of ImageNet, the average images of the single clusters consistently discover viewpoints or common poses.": 149,
  "Figure 11: Samples of detected bounding boxes around different objects.": 150,
  "Figure 12: Left: Average images and image samples of the de- tected bounding boxes from the 'tusker' and 'stealth aircraft' cate- gories. Right: Average images and examples of three big clusters after k-means clustering (see Sec. 4.3 for detail). Different view- points and poses emerge in the \"tusker\" category. The first row shows tuskers in side view, front view and in profile. One cluster of aircraft images displays mostly planes on the ground.": 153,
  "5. Discussion and Future Work": 154,
  "Our future work has two goals:": 155,
  "5.1. Completing ImageNet": 156,
  "The current ImageNet constitutes ~ 10% of the Word- Net synsets. To further speed up the construction process, we will continue to explore more effective methods to eval- uate the AMT user labels and optimize the number of repe- titions needed to accurately verify each image. At the com- pletion of ImageNet, we aim to (i have roughly 50 million clean, diverse and full resolution images spread over ap- proximately 50K synsets; (ii) deliver ImageNet to research communities by making it publicly available and readily ac-": 157,
  "254": 158,
  "cessible online. We plan to use cloud storage to enable effi- cient distribution of ImageNet data; (iii) extend ImageNet to include more information such as localization as described in Sec. 4.3, segmentation, cross-synset referencing of im- ages, as well as expert annotation for difficult synsets and (iv) foster an ImageNet community and develop an online platform where everyone can contribute to and benefit from ImageNet resources.": 160,
  "5.2. Exploiting ImageNet": 161,
  "We hope ImageNet will become a central resource for a broad of range of vision related research. For the computer vision community in particular, we envision the following possible applications.": 162,
  "A training resource. Most of today's object recognition algorithms have focused on a small number of common ob- jects, such as pedestrians, cars and faces. This is mainly due to the high availability of images for these categories. Fig. 6 has shown that even the largest datasets today have a strong bias in their coverage of different types of objects. Ima- geNet, on the other hand, contains a large number of images for nearly all object classes including rare ones. One inter- esting research direction could be to transfer knowledge of common objects to learn rare object models.": 163,
  "A benchmark dataset. The current benchmark datasets in computer vision such as Caltech101/256 and PASCAL have played a critical role in advancing object recognition and scene classification research. We believe that the high quality, diversity and large scale of ImageNet will enable it to become a new and challenging benchmark dataset for future research.": 164,
  "Introducing new semantic relations for visual modeling. Because ImageNet is uniquely linked to all concrete nouns of WordNet whose synsets are richly interconnected, one could also exploit different semantic relations for instance to learn part models. To move towards total scene under- standing, it is also helpful to consider different depths of the semantic hierarchy.": 165,
  "Human vision research. ImageNet's rich structure and dense coverage of the image world may help advance the understanding of the human visual system. For example, the question of whether a concept can be illustrated by im- ages is much more complex than one would expect at first. Aligning the cognitive hierarchy with the \"visual\" hierarchy also remains an unexplored area.": 166,
