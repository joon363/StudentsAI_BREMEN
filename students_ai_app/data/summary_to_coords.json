  "ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical image database built upon the WordNet structure. It aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full-resolution images, resulting in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. The database currently consists of 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images. ImageNet is larger in scale, diversity, and accuracy than current image datasets. The data collection scheme involves Amazon Mechanical Turk, and the usefulness of ImageNet is illustrated through applications in object recognition, image classification, and automatic object clustering.": {

  "The digital era has led to an explosion of data, with billions of photos on platforms like Flickr and YouTube. ImageNet is introduced as a large-scale ontology of images, which is a critical resource for developing advanced, large-scale content-based image search and image understanding algorithms. ImageNet uses the hierarchical structure of WordNet, aiming to provide 500-1000 images per synset, resulting in tens of millions of cleanly sorted images. The database is publicly available and offers a large-scale, accurate, and diverse image resource for visual recognition applications.": {
