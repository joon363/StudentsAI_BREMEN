        "content": "{\"subsections\":[\"Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context.\",\"Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost.\",\"Features matter. The last decade of progress on various visual recognition tasks has been based considerably on the use of SIFT and HOG.\",\"The significance of the ImageNet result was vigorously debated during the ILSVRC 2012 workshop. The central issue can be distilled to the following: To what extent do the CNN classification results on ImageNet generalize to object detection results on the PASCAL VOC Challenge?\",\"We answer this question by bridging the gap between image classification and object detection. This paper is the first to show that a CNN can lead to dramatically higher object detection performance on PASCAL VOC as compared to systems based on simpler HOG-like features.\",\"Our system is also quite efficient. The only class-specific computations are a reasonably small matrix-vector product and greedy non-maximum suppression.\",\"Understanding the failure modes of our approach is also critical for improving it, and so we report results from the detection analysis tool of Hoiem et al.\",\"We applied the excellent detection analysis tool from Hoiem et al. in order to reveal our method's error modes, understand how fine-tuning changes them, and to see how our error types compare with DPM.\"],\"figures\":[\"Figure 1: Object detection system overview. Our system (1) takes an input image, (2) extracts around 2000 bottom-up region proposals, (3) computes features for each proposal using a large convolutional neural network (CNN), and then (4) classifies each region using class-specific linear SVMs.\",\"Figure 2: Warped training samples from VOC 2007 train.\",\"Figure 3: Top regions for six pool5 units. Receptive fields and activation values are drawn in white. Some units are aligned to concepts, such as people (row 1) or text (4). Other units capture texture and material properties, such as dot arrays (2) and specular reflections (6).\",\"Figure 4: Distribution of top-ranked false positive (FP) types. Each plot shows the evolving distribution of FP types as more FPs are considered in order of decreasing score. Each FP is categorized into 1 of 4 types: Loc-poor localization (a detection with an IoU overlap with the correct class between 0.1 and 0.5, or a duplicate); Sim-confusion with a similar category; Oth-confusion with a dissimilar object category; BG-a FP that fired on background.\",\"Figure 5: Sensitivity to object characteristics. Each plot shows the mean (over classes) normalized AP for the highest and lowest performing subsets within six different object characteristics (occlusion, truncation, bounding box area, aspect ratio, viewpoint, part visibility).\"],\"equations\":[],\"methods\":[\"R-CNN: Regions with CNN features, which combines region proposals with CNNs.\",\"Supervised pre-training on a large auxiliary dataset (ILSVRC), followed by domain-specific fine-tuning on a small dataset (PASCAL).\",\"Bounding box regression method to reduce localization errors.\"],\"metrics\":[\"Mean average precision (mAP) on PASCAL VOC 2010 and 2012 datasets.\",\"Comparison with other methods like DPM, UVA, and Regionlets using selective search region proposals.\"],\"words\":[\"plateaued\",\"ensemble systems\",\"high-capacity\",\"bottom-up region proposals\",\"domain-specific fine-tuning\",\"canonical\",\"visual recognition tasks\",\"ImageNet\",\"bridging the gap\",\"class-specific computations\",\"greedy non-maximum suppression\",\"failure modes\",\"error modes\",\"bounding box regression\"]}",
